This code was made by me following the "Challenge 1" of the Junior Programming Course on Unity.
To use it I recommend that you create a new empty GameObject and add the script to it.
The script will create a plane with a mesh collider and a rigidbody.
The plane will move forward and rotate according to the user's input.
The plane will also spin its propellers automatically.
The camera will follow the plane along with the user's input.
